🧠 Machine Learning & Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning and Data Analysis Projects repository!
This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level ML and data analysis projects that I’m building as part of my learning journey. Each project focuses on understanding key concepts, experimenting with different models, and applying practical data science techniques.

🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is learning and experimentation.
I’m exploring various machine learning algorithms, preprocessing techniques, and evaluation methods by implementing small-scale, hands-on projects.

📚 Projects Included

Some of the projects currently in this repo include:

🎵 Music Recommendation System – Predicts or suggests songs based on audio features such as energy, tempo, and valence.

💬 Sentiment Analysis – Classifies text data (e.g., reviews or tweets) into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

📈 Regression Models – Predict continuous values like song popularity or house prices using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

🧩 Classification Models – Explore models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs, and Naive Bayes for categorical prediction tasks.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

NumPy, Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive exploration and experimentation

📊 What You’ll Find Here

Data preprocessing steps (cleaning, encoding, scaling, splitting)

Model training and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, cross-validation)

Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R², and MSE

Visualization of results and feature importance

Clear, commented code for learning and reference

🚀 Future Plans

Add more end-to-end ML pipelines

Implement deep learning models (using TensorFlow / PyTorch)

Work on more real-world datasets

Document insights and learning progress

🧩 Disclaimer

These projects are for educational and practice purposes only.
The code and results are part of my personal learning journey in machine learning and data analysis.
